I'm a Back-End Developer with 3+ years of experience, mostly rocking **Node.js** and **AWS** (Serverless stuff included).  

I love keeping apps running smoothly, making sure they perform well and are always available. Graduating in Analysis and Systems Development (Unipê), I’m curious about tech and driven to deliver real value through code.
